Release history and notes
=========================
`Sequence based identifiers
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning#Sequence-based_identifiers>`_
are used for versioning (schema follows below):

.. code-block:: text

    major.minor[.revision]

- It's always safe to upgrade within the same minor version (for example, from
  0.3 to 0.3.4).
- Minor version changes might be backwards incompatible. Read the
  release notes carefully before upgrading (for example, when upgrading from
  0.3.4 to 0.4).
- All backwards incompatible changes are mentioned in this document.

0.19.2
------
2022-07-14

- Make it easier to get initial data for the `ViewFormEntry` view.
- Apply black and isort on entire code base.

0.19.1
------
2022-07-12

- Added class-based view for Dashboard.

0.19
----
2022-07-11

- Introduce class based views. Function based views are still supported
  and will be supported until at least 0.23.

  Migration to class based views is simple. Only your project's ``urls.py``
  would change:

  .. code-block:: python

      urlpatterns = [
          # ...
          url(r'^fobi/', include('fobi.urls.class_based.view')),
          url(r'^fobi/', include('fobi.urls.class_based.edit')),
          # ...
      ]

  To use function based views, simply replace the previous line with:

  .. code-block:: python

      urlpatterns = [
          # ...
          url(r'^fobi/', include('fobi.urls.view')),
          url(r'^fobi/', include('fobi.urls.edit')),
          # ...
      ]

- Class-based permissions (work only in combination with class-based views).

  Example:

  .. code-block:: python

      from fobi.permissions.definitions import edit_form_entry_permissions
      from fobi.permissions.generic import BasePermission
      from fobi.permissions.helpers import (
          any_permission_required_func, login_required,
      )

      class EditFormEntryPermission(BasePermission):
      """Permission to edit form entries."""

      def has_permission(self, request, view) -> bool:
          return login_required(request) and any_permission_required_func(
              edit_form_entry_permissions
          )(request.user)

      def has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj) -> bool:
          return login_required(request) and any_permission_required_func(
              edit_form_entry_permissions
          )(request.user) and obj.user == request.user

- Minor fixes.

0.8
---
2016-10-17

Release supported by `Lund University Cognitive Science
<http://www.lucs.lu.se/choice-blindness-group/>`_.

- Adding form-wizards functionality. Note, that at the moment only
  `bootstrap3` theme was updated to fully support the form wizards. Although,
  all other themes would by default support form-wizard functionality, they
  may not look as nice as they should be (to be fixed in 0.8.x releases
  shortly).
- The `six` package requirements increased to >= 1.8.
- Tests comply with pep8.
- Fixed recently broken drag-and-drop ordering of the form elements.
- Fixed typo for HTML id "tab-form-elemenets" -> "tab-form-elements". You
  may need to update your custom CSS/JS/HTML accordingly. See the listing
  0.8.a for the files affected.
- An additional property `form_view_form_entry_option_class` has been added
  to all the themes. Change your custom CSS/JS/HTML accordingly. See the
  listing 0.8.b for the files affected.
- Fixed drag-and-drop not working for ordering of form elements. #43
- Fixed issue with non-proper rendering of the form-importer templates.

.. note::

    Although this release does not contain backwards incompatible changes, there
    have been several changes in GUI and some parts of the generic HTML and themes
    were updated. If you have custom themes implemented, you should likely make
    some minor updates to the HTML in order to reflect the latest GUI changes.
    The following templates have been affected:

      * fobi.contrib.plugins.form_elements.fields.select
      * fobi.contrib.plugins.form_elements.fields.select_multiple

-----
2014-12-04

- Helper script (management command) in order to migrate django-fobi==0.3.*
  data to django-fobi==0.4.* data (caused by renaming the ``birthday`` field
  to ``date_drop_down`` - see the release notes of 0.4 below). Follow the steps
  precisely in order to painlessly upgrade your django-fobi==0.3.* to
  django-fobi==0.4.*:

  1. Install django-fobi>=0.4.2:

     .. code-block:: sh

         pip install django-fobi>=0.4.2

  2. In your settings change the:

     .. code-block:: python

         'fobi.contrib.plugins.form_elements.fields.birthday'

     to:

     .. code-block:: python

         'fobi.contrib.plugins.form_elements.fields.date_drop_down'

  3. Run the ``migrate_03_to_04`` management command. Note, that as of version
     0.4.24, the `migrate_03_to_04` command has been renamed to
     `fobi_migrate_03_to_04`.:

     .. code-block:: sh

         ./manage.py migrate_03_to_04

0.4.1
-----
2014-12-04

- Fixes in Foundation5 and Simple themes related to the changes in error
  validation/handling of hidden fields.

0.4
---
2014-12-03

.. note::

    Note, that this release contains minor backwards incompatible changes. The
    changes may affect your existing forms and data. Read the notes below
    carefully (UPDATE 2014-12-04: the django-fobi==0.4.2 contains a management
    command which makes the necessary changes in the database for safe upgrade).

- The ``captcha`` field has been moved from
  ``fobi.contrib.plugins.form_elements.fields.captcha`` to
  ``fobi.contrib.plugins.form_elements.security.captcha``. Make sure to update
  the package paths in ``INSTALLED_APPS`` of your projects' settings module
  (settings.py) when upgrading to this version.
- The ``honeypot`` field has been added.
- The ``birthday`` field has been renamed to ``date_drop_down`` (A real
  ``birthday`` field is still to come in later releases). The change causes
  backwards incompatibility issues if you have used that ``birthday`` field.
  If you haven't - you have nothing to worry. If you have been using it,
  grab the 0.3.4 version, copy the
  ``fobi.contrib.plugins.form_elements.fields.date_drop_down`` package to
  your project apps, make necessary path changes and update the package paths
  in ``INSTALLED_APPS`` settings module (settings.py) before upgrading to this
  version. Then, in Django admin management interface, replace all the
  occurrences of ``Birthday`` field with ``Date drop down`` field.
- Better error validation/handling of hidden fields. A new form snippet
  template added for displaying the non-field and hidden fields errors. The new
  template makes a part of a standard theme as an attribute
  ``form_non_field_and_hidden_errors_snippet_template``.
- Minor fixes in generic templates.
- An additional property ``is_hidden`` added to the hidden form elements. Those
  form elements would be getting a default TextInput widget in the edit mode
  instead of the widget they come from by default. It's possible to provide an
  alternative widget for the edit mode as well. Default value of the
  ``is_hidden`` is set to False.

0.3.4
-----
2014-11-23

- New settings ``FOBI_FAIL_ON_ERRORS_IN_FORM_ELEMENT_PLUGINS`` and
  ``FOBI_FAIL_ON_ERRORS_IN_FORM_HANDLER_PLUGINS`` introduced. They do as
  their name tells. Default value for both is False.
- Fixed exceptions raised when unicode characters were used as form names.
- Fixed exceptions raised when unicode characters were used as field labels.
- Fixes in the `db_store` and `mail` plugins related to usage of unicode
  characters.

0.3
---
2014-11-09

.. note::

    Note, that this release contains minor backwards incompatible changes. The
    changes do not anyhow affect your existing forms or data. The only thing you
    need to do is update the app paths in the ``settings`` module of your project.

- Minor core improvements related to the theming of the form handler plugins.
- Several presentational form element plugins have been renamed.
  The ``fobi.contrib.plugins.form_elements.content.image`` plugin has been
  renamed to ``fobi.contrib.plugins.form_elements.content.content_image``.
  The ``fobi.contrib.plugins.form_elements.content.text`` plugin has been
  renamed to ``fobi.contrib.plugins.form_elements.content.content_text``.
  The ``fobi.contrib.plugins.form_elements.content.video`` plugin has been
  renamed to ``fobi.contrib.plugins.form_elements.content.content_video``.
  If you have used any of the above mentioned plugins, make sure to update
  the app paths in the ``settings`` module of your project.
- The ``fobi.contrib.plugins.form_elements.content.dummy`` plugin has been moved
  to ``fobi.contrib.plugins.form_elements.test.dummy`` location. If you have
  used it, make sure to update the its' path in the ``settings`` module of
  your project.
- Added readme to the following content form element plugins: ``dummy``,
  ``content_image``, ``content_text`` and ``content_video``.
- Added ``foundation5`` and ``simple`` theme widgets for ``db_store`` plugin.
- If you have been overriding the defaults of the ``db_store`` plugin, change
  the prefix from ``FOBI_PLUGIN_DB_EXPORT_`` to ``FOBI_PLUGIN_DB_STORE_``. For
  example,  ``FOBI_PLUGIN_DB_EXPORT_CSV_DELIMITER`` should become
  ``FOBI_PLUGIN_DB_STORE_CSV_DELIMITER``.
- Mentioning the ``fobi_find_broken_entries`` management command in the
  documentation, as well as improving the management command itself (more
  verbose output).
- Birthday field added.

0.2.1
-----
2014-11-06

- Minor improvements of the ``db_store`` plugin.
- Minor improvements of the ``simple`` theme. Make sure that custom
  form handler actions are properly shown in the form handlers list.
- Make it possible to fail silently on missing form element or form
  handler plugins by setting the respected values to False:
  ``FOBI_FAIL_ON_MISSING_FORM_ELEMENT_PLUGINS``,
  ``FOBI_FAIL_ON_MISSING_FORM_HANDLER_PLUGINS``. Otherwise an appropriate
  exception is raised.

0.2
---
2014-11-05

Note, that this release contains minor backwards incompatible changes.

- Minor (backwards incompatible) changes in the form handler plugin API.
  From now on both ``custom_actions`` and ``get_custom_actions`` methods
  accept ``form_entry`` (obligatory) and ``request`` (optional) arguments. If
  you have written your own or have changed existing form handler plugins
  with use of one of the above mentioned methods, append those arguments to
  the method declarations when upgrading to this version. If you haven't
  written your own or changed existing form handler plugins, you may just
  upgrade to this version.
- Added data export features to the ``db_store`` plugin.
- Minor fixes in ``db_store`` plugin.
- Added missing documentation for the ``feincms_integration`` app.
- Updated translations for Dutch and Russian.

0.1.6
-----
2014-10-25

- Minor improvements in the theming API. From now on the
  ``view_embed_form_entry_ajax_template`` template would be used
  when integrating the form rendering from other products (for example,
  a CMS page, which has a widget which references the form object. If
  that property is left empty, the ``view_form_entry_ajax_template``
  is used. For a success page the ``embed_form_entry_submitted_ajax_template``
  template would be used.
- Functional improvements of the FeinCMS integration (the widget). If you
  have used the FeinCMS widget of earlier versions, you likely want to update
  to this one. From now on you can select a custom form title and the button
  text, as well as provide custom success page title and the success  message;
  additionally, it has been made possible to hide the form- or success-page-
  titles.
